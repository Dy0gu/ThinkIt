# Think of a number... 🧿🎲

ThinkIt is a simple program/game that will guess the number (from 0 up to 127) that the user is thinking of, in 7 tries or less, by asking a series of questions. It uses of binary reconstruction to guess, all this is done on an Arduino board where visual cues are displayed upon interaction, using LEDs.

## Requirements 📋

- Arduino Uno Rev3 with atleast least 10x 5V LEDs, 10x 220 Ω Resistors, 20x male-male jumper wires and a breadboard.

## Installation 🛠️

- Clone the repository:

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/dy0guy/think-it.git
  ```

- Mount the board LEDs and buttons as per the pins used in the code.

- Upload and launch the program on an Arduino while plugged in to a computer for serial monitor output.
