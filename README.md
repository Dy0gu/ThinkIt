ThinkIt is a simple program/game that will guess the number the user is thinking of, in 7 tries or less, by asking the user to answer a series of questions. It makes use of binary reconstruction to guess the number, all this is done on an Arduino board where visual cues are displayed upon interaction, using LEDs.
